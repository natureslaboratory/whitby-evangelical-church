                        The church was formed in 1973. The catalyst was the
                        decision of Rev Peter Brumby to leave Methodism. He had
                        been serving churches in Grosmont, Littlebeck, Esk Valley,
                        Briggswath and Sleights, and many of those who were
                        involved at the beginning of the church had been converted
                        under Peter's ministry.

                        Whitby Evangelical Fellowship (as the church was then known)
                        first met in June 1973 and Rev John Tindall conducted the
                        church's inaugural covenant service on 28th June 1973. The
                        church initially met at a home in Sleights. Peter Brumby had
                        gone to Spain to minister at an English-speaking church on
                        the Costa del Sol, but was called as the church's first
                        minister in December 1973. From 1974 to 1978 the church met
                        at Ruswarp village hall, and then at Stakesby School and
                        Whitby School, before the purchase of the present premises
                        in Skinner Street. The building in Skinner Street had been
                        previously a ballroom, a bakery and caf√©, and a builders'
                        merchant, and required extensive renovation and alteration.
                        At this time the fellowship became known as Whitby
                        Evangelical Church.

                    <p>
                        After 17 years service, Peter Brumby resigned the pastorate
                        to take up a wider ministry in the North of England. He then
                        served as minister at Newcastle Reformed Evangelical Church.
                        After a three year vacancy, John Winter was called in 1993 to
                        be the pastor. He had been involved in a church planting work
                        for the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches (FIEC)
                        in Newton Aycliffe, Co Durham. In December 1999, John Winter
                        resigned the pastorate, and after a further three year vacancy,
                        David Magowan was called to be the church's pastor. David
                        moved onto Carey Baptist Church, Reading, in August 2009. In
                        March 2014 Peter Robinson (Honiton) responded to a call to
                        the pastorate and became the minister of the church.

                        Since 1973, the church has seen a steady growth in attendance
                        and membership. The normal morning congregation of around 80-100
                        is often swelled with holidaying visitors, particularly during the
                        summer months. There are various activities in the church calendar
                        to cater for distinctive groups within the church family. These
                        include Sunday School, 6-10 Club for Primary aged children, SAS
                        for teenagers, Mums and Tots, Ladies Meeting, Midweek Bible Study,
                        etc.
